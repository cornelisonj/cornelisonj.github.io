## Overview

During my senior project, I worked with Google Apps Script to finish/fix a custom tool used to upload data from google spreadsheets directly into Big Query. 

### Big Query

Real quick, Big Query is a part of Google Cloud that stores the data warehouses, data sets, and data tables. It is also where one can create query's to view, create, delete, alter and change the data warehouse, data sets, and data tables.

### Google Apps Script

Now back to Google Apps Script. Essentially, Google Apps Script is JavaScript with built in methods and classes to work with Google Products. Like mentioned above, I used Google Apps Script to build a tool that could take a google spreadsheet filled with data, select the columns, change the column headers, and store it in Big Query. Below is a picture of the google sheet data load tool.

To get to Google Apps Script from Spreadsheets, click on "Tools" at the top of the page, then click on "script editor". You should then be taken to the image below.

One not to make with Google Apps Script, if you want to see the output, you need to use `Logger.log()` or `console.log()`
